title: Create a Mintlist
---

# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

You can create a Mintlist and populate it with configs for multiple NFTs. Users can interact with the Mintlist and
mint NFTs from it one-by-one.

Setting up a Mintlist is a simple two-step process. First, you create one. Then, you add configs for NFTs to it.

You can use the interactive widget below to create your own Mintlist.
