NFToken is a simple, cheap NFT standard for Solana.

### NFToken is 4x Cheaper Than Metaplex

Creating an NFT with NFToken costs about 2M Lamports or $0.08.

With Metaplex, this costs about 10M Lamports or $0.32.

### NFToken is Simple and Easy to Use

Metaplex requires 4 separate accounts for each NFT. This makes it incredibly difficult to do simple queries like finding all NFTs and owners for a collection. In addition, this complex structure has caused security issues.

NFToken is simple which makes it easy to build on top of and query.

### NFToken Doesn't Require the Terminal

These docs are interactive. That means you can get started without even opening the terminal. You can even create a primary drop (equivalent of Candy Machine) without installing anything.

## Try It Out

You can create an NFT in just a few seconds.
