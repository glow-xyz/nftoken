## How does this compare with the Metaplex NFT standard?

The Metaplex standard was written built [very quickly](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1524798066347237376) and released on top of the SPL Token Program which is designed for Fungible Tokens (not NFTs).

While the Metaplex standard has gained popularity, it is difficult and expensive for developers and creators to use. Also Metaplex, is a private company that has not explained how they will make money or shared a public roadmap.

NFToken is designed to be cheaper, easier to use, and more open than Metaplex. Creating an NFT with NFToken is < 1/3 the price of a Metaplex NFT.

## Does this work on Bitcoin or Ethereum?

No, the NFToken standard works only on the Solana blockchain. That means you'll need a Solana wallet like [Glow](https://glow.app) to interact with the NFToken standard.
